            As IT professionals we have long desired an easy to use interface for basic administrative functions.
            For 4 years we developed a PHP version of this app called ADAM which saw minor successs. What it provided
            left an empty feeling for what it couldn't do. We decided to start from scratch on a new plan that had a
            clear ending objective and a solid premise.

            Blazam was created as a side-project/hobby for enthusiastic IT professionals with developer skills. It has a focus of
            supporting non technical users with tasks that would otherwise be performed by technical staff. It has evolved into a fully
            functional and powerful product that has become a go to for those who have tried it.

            Blazam is designed for the over-worked system administrator, the organizations that lack the funding or means
            to shell out countless dollars to greedy corporations to receive a poorly supported and foreign-produced development.
