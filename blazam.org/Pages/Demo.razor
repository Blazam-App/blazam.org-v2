        We've prepared a pair of demos connected to a sample Active Directory Domain. They're fully
        functional but there are some considerations...

            There are no computers in the sample domain, this would be expensive to replicate.

            The demos are going to be slower than a real installation. They are VM's and the host machine only has 24GB of RAM 
            and an i5-4590s, quite old. So trying to run 6 Windows VM's and 1 Linux VM on it, on top of it's own OS, is a bit of a stretch.
